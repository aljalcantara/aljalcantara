### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

For 5 years of freelancing, I've coded, simulated, and fabricated electronic and automation projects involving microcontrollers, robotics, control systems, and instrumentation using C/C++, Java, MATLAB, and PLC. Within those 5 years, I also have developed multiple web apps using HTML/CSS/JavaScript and PHP/MySQL without using any framework. I want to make a career change and focus on software and web development by learning new frameworks and possibly new programming languages.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on expanding my software and web dev skills by learning new frameworks.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React, Typescript, and NodeJS.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on web dev projects.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with web development.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about microcontrollers, robotics, automation and control systems.
