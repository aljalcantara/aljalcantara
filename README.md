### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 27 year old web designer and web developer, portrait artist, illustrator, electronics programmer, 3d designer and AR developer.
I worked freelance for 5 years, focusing more on electronics and automation projects including microcontrollers, IOT, robotics, control systems, and instrumentation using C/C++, Java, MATLAB, and PLC.
I've recently decided to switch career and focus more on UI/UX design and web development.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on personal experiments using Three.js and GLSL shaders.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™ve recently learned React, Next.js, Three.js, and GSAP, and I created my portfolio website as my first project using these frameworks.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on web dev projects.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with GLSL programming.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about microcontrollers, robotics, automation and control systems.
